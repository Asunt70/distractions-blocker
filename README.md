Distractions Blocker

I mainly created this to the purpose of not wasting time in dumb website as can be social media etc. For what i prefer, i wanted an extension that doesnt allow me to unblock sites,
normally they allow u, making u go to the same stuff again.

Contributing

if u want to change aesthethics, that is up to you, in blocked.html u can change it with the desired message, maybe making that accesible to non coders user so that they can change it might be good

# Installation Guide: Installing the Extension Locally

Follow these steps to load and use the extension on your Chrome browser without publishing it on the Web Store.

## Step 1: Download the Extension Files

1. Download the extension as a `.zip` file.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into a folder on your computer.

## Step 2: Enable Developer Mode

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. In the address bar, type `chrome://extensions` and press Enter.
3. At the top-right corner, toggle **Developer mode** to the **ON** position.

## Step 3: Load the Unpacked Extension

1. Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears after enabling Developer mode.
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension.
3. Select the folder and click **"Open"** (or **"Select Folder"** on some systems).

The extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions.
