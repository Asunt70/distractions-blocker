# Distractions Blocker

I mainly created this to stop myself from wasting time on dumb websites—social media and similar garbage.  
What I wanted was an extension that **doesn't** let me unblock sites. Most blockers do, which just sends you right back into the same trap.

This one doesn't.

## Contributing

Right now, this only works with **Chrome**, or any Chromium-based browser.  
I haven’t published it to the Chrome Web Store yet because... I had to pay money lol. but if u wanna to contribute with that reach me out on discord: asunt_

So I’m sharing it here instead. If you want to contribute, here’s what you can do:

- Add support for other browsers (Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- That’s it, really.

If you want to change how it looks, that’s on you.  
You can edit the message in `blocked.html` to say whatever you want.  
Might be cool to make that editable without needing to touch code, for non-coder users.

Built for myself. Shared for anyone who also needs to get their crap together.


# Installation Guide: Installing the Extension Locally

Follow these steps to load and use the extension on your Chrome browser without publishing it on the Web Store.

## Step 1: Download the Extension Files

1. Download the extension as a `.zip` file.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into a folder on your computer.

## Step 2: Enable Developer Mode

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. In the address bar, type `chrome://extensions` and press Enter.
3. At the top-right corner, toggle **Developer mode** to the **ON** position.

## Step 3: Load the Unpacked Extension

1. Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears after enabling Developer mode.
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension.
3. Select the folder and click **"Open"** (or **"Select Folder"** on some systems).

The extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions.

## Step 4: Using the Extension

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension Not Loading?**
  - Double-check you have extracted all files correctly.
