Distractions Blocker

I mainly created this to the purpose of not wasting time in dumb website as can be social media etc. For what i prefer, i wanted an extension that doesnt allow me to unblock sites,
normally they allow u, making u go to the same stuff again.

Contributing
right know, it just has chrome support, or well it was created with chrome objetive mainly. i haven't published it yet to the chrome web store cuz i had to play lol.
that's why im sharing it with you here.
so here's a thing u can contribute with

- more browsers support
- that's it

if u want to change aesthethics, that is up to you, in blocked.html u can change it with the desired message, maybe making that accesible to non coders user so that they can change it might be good
